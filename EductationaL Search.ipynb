        "First, we need to install and import the necessary libraries and tools. This includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **LangGraph** – for orchestrating our AI agents in a graph workflow.\n",

        "\n",
        "- A **Perplexity Sonar API key** (sign up on Perplexity AI for developer access).\n",

        "\n",
        "Now that our environment is ready, let's outline the **DeepSearch pipeline**. The workflow consists of multiple steps (or tools) that the AI can use, orchestrated by a central decision-maker agent (often called the “Oracle” in LangGraph terminology ([LangGraph and Research Agents | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langgraph-research-agent/#:~:text=Defining%20the%20Oracle))).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key components of our pipeline:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Oracle (Decision Maker):** A GPT-4.5-powered agent that will decide which tool to use at each step, based on the user’s query and intermediate results. This is the brain of the operation, orchestrating the flow ([LangGraph and Research Agents | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langgraph-research-agent/#:~:text=Defining%20the%20Oracle)).\n",
        "- **Tool 1 – Web Search (Sonar):** Searches the web for relevant info (news, articles, blogs) about the crypto company. Powered by Perplexity Sonar API for up-to-date, citation-backed results ([Sonar by Perplexity](https://sonar.perplexity.ai/#:~:text=Build%20with%20the%20best%20AI,Get%20started%20in%20minutes)).\n",
        "- **Tool 2 – Document OCR & QA (Mistral OCR):** Reads a scanned financial report or document related to the company (e.g., an annual report PDF) and extracts key info. We’ll use an OCR engine plus an LLM (like Mistral’s Pixtral model) to interpret the text ([Guide to Building OCR Systems with Pixtral-12B](https://www.e2enetworks.com/blog/a-guide-to-building-ocr-systems-using-pixtral-12b#:~:text=Pixtral,scale%20OCR)).\n",
        "- **Tool 3 – Financial Data Fetch (Crypto API):** Pulls quantitative data (price history, trading volume, etc.) via a crypto data API (CoinGecko in our case). This gives us structured performance metrics.\n",
        "- **Tool 4 – Quick Analysis (Gemini-2.0-Flash):** A fast LLM used for small tasks or calculations. _Gemini 2.0 Flash_ is Google’s efficient model designed for low-latency tasks ([Gemini 2.0 model updates: 2.0 Flash, Flash-Lite, Pro Experimental](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-updates-february-2025/#:~:text=Experimental%20blog,reason%20through%20more%20complex%20problems)) ([The next chapter of the Gemini era for developers - Google Developers Blog](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/the-next-chapter-of-the-gemini-era-for-developers/#:~:text=3,party%20functions%20via%20function%20calling)). We might use it to, say, calculate percentage changes or categorize sentiment quickly.\n",
        "- **Tool 5 – Final Answer Synthesizer (Report Generator):** This is not a tool that fetches new data, but rather a formatter that compiles all findings into a coherent report. We will use GPT-4.5 here to synthesize the final answer, ensuring a well-structured output for the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using LangGraph, we can define each of these as nodes in a graph. The Oracle node will have edges connecting to each tool node. On each iteration, the Oracle decides which tool is needed next (it might search first, then fetch data, then perhaps search again, etc., in a loop) ([LangGraph and Research Agents | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langgraph-research-agent/#:~:text=action%20steps,step%20like%20searching%20the%20internet)) . This is similar to the ReAct (Reason+Act) loop but implemented as a graph for more control. The process continues until the Oracle decides it has enough info and calls the Final Answer tool to produce the report ([LangGraph and Research Agents | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langgraph-research-agent/#:~:text=)) ([LangGraph and Research Agents | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langgraph-research-agent/#:~:text=%40tool%28,in%20the%20form%20of%20a)).\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's implement each tool one by one using the `@tool` decorator provided by LangGraph (which is actually part of LangChain’s toolkit).\n",

        "\n",
        "This tool will accept a search query (string) and return a summary of results. Under the hood, it will call the Sonar API.

We can use it similarly to how we’d use an LLM with tools – in fact, Sonar has a chat completion interface where the `model=\"sonar-pro\"` can be used with the OpenAI client ([Perplexity Sonar API: Reliable, Scalable, and Developer-Friendly](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/01/perplexity-sonar-api/#:~:text=client%20%3D%20OpenAI%28api_key%3DYOUR_API_KEY%2C%20base_url%3D)).\n",

For now, this function just prints a log and returns a dummy string.\n",

We’ll include a tool that uses a hypothetical `gemini_flash` model to do a quick computation or categorization.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, we might ask this tool to calculate the percentage change between two numbers or to classify sentiment from text. This isn’t strictly necessary (GPT-4.5 could do it too), but it illustrates using a specialized model for efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let’s create a small tool to compute percentage change given old and new values:\n",

        "```python\n",
        "@tool(\"calc_percentage_change\")\n",

        "We might not explicitly call this in our final agent workflow, but it’s an example of a micro-tool where using a smaller or faster model could be advantageous if we had one (Gemini Flash could handle such tasks quickly without bothering the more powerful GPT-4.5).\n",

        "\n",
        "To keep it simple, we’ll not break it into too many sections, just maybe an introduction and a body. The final tool will just accept a string (the compiled report text) and return it (the LangGraph agent will treat this as the end of execution).\n",

        "- *Market Growth:* Binance Coin (BNB) price increased by **20%** over the past year (from ~$250 to ~$300), with market capitalization rising from about $40B to $50B, reflecting investor confidence and platform growth.\n",
        "- *User Base & Volume:* The company’s user base expanded significantly, as noted in the 2022 annual report, contributing to higher trading volumes and revenue (report indicated **20% YoY revenue growth** ([Guide to Building OCR Systems with Pixtral-12B](https://www.e2enetworks.com/blog/a-guide-to-building-ocr-systems-using-pixtral-12b#:~:text=Pixtral,scale%20OCR))).\n",

        "- *Market Conditions:* Bullish crypto market phases (e.g., late 2020 and 2021) boosted Binance’s transaction volumes and fee revenues, while bear markets tested its resilience.\n",
        "- *Regulatory Environment:* Regulatory crackdowns in certain countries posed challenges. Binance’s agility in responding (such as implementing stricter KYC and regional compliance efforts) helped it maintain global operations.\n",
        "- *Security Incidents:* Past security incidents (like the 2019 hack) led to short-term dips in performance. However, Binance’s quick fund SAFU insurance and improved security measures helped restore user trust, allowing performance to recover.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Jina AI’s DeepSearch Guide:** Provided the conceptual foundation for DeepSearch – an agent that _“combines searching, reading and autonomous reasoning”_ to answer complex queries ([DeepSearch by Jina.ai: The breakthrough in AI search for complex queries! - ai-rockstars.com](https://ai-rockstars.com/jina-ai-deeepsearch/#:~:text=With%20DeepSearch%2C%20Jina%20AI%20brings,founded%20answers%20to%20difficult%20questions)). The idea of iterative read-search loops and large context usage (up to 500k tokens) comes from Jina’s work, which showed how DeepSearch can yield high-quality answers at the cost of more compute ([DeepSearch by Jina.ai: The breakthrough in AI search for complex queries! - ai-rockstars.com](https://ai-rockstars.com/jina-ai-deeepsearch/#:~:text=DeepSearch%20is%20characterized%20by%20an,and%20quality%20of%20information%20processing)) ([DeepSearch by Jina.ai: The breakthrough in AI search for complex queries! - ai-rockstars.com](https://ai-rockstars.com/jina-ai-deeepsearch/#:~:text=,and%20high%20token%20costs)). The writing style of Jina’s blog (clear explanations with a touch of marketing flair) influenced our introduction and breakdown of DeepSearch concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **LangGraph Scientific Paper Agent Example:** We borrowed coding patterns from an example that uses LangGraph for research agents ([LangGraph and Research Agents | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langgraph-research-agent/#:~:text=from%20langchain_core)) ([LangGraph and Research Agents | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langgraph-research-agent/#:~:text=%40tool%28,5)). In particular, the use of the `@tool` decorator to define agent tools and the concept of an Oracle LLM making function calls are drawn from that example. The structure of final answer formatting was inspired by how the example enforces sections in the final output ([LangGraph and Research Agents | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langgraph-research-agent/#:~:text=%40tool%28,the%20form%20of%20a%20research)) ([LangGraph and Research Agents | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langgraph-research-agent/#:~:text=,4%20paragraphs)). We adapted that idea to create a final report tool for our use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Pinecone’s _LangGraph and Research Agents_ Blog:** This resource explained how graph-based agents offer more control and transparency than traditional chain-of-thought agents ([LangGraph and Research Agents | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langgraph-research-agent/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Graph)). It influenced our decision to use LangGraph and how we set `tool_choice=\"any\"` to allow flexible tool use ([LangGraph and Research Agents | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langgraph-research-agent/#:~:text=The%20Oracle%20consists%20of%20an,that%20separately%20in%20our%20graph)). The diagrams of agent workflows ([LangGraph and Research Agents | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langgraph-research-agent/)) (showing nodes like `fetch_arxiv`, `web_search`, etc.) helped conceptualize our crypto analysis agent as a similar graph of nodes (Oracle -> search, data fetch, OCR, etc. -> final answer).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Perplexity Sonar API Documentation:** Perplexity’s blog and docs on Sonar guided our integration of the search tool. We learned that Sonar can be accessed via an OpenAI-compatible endpoint with model names like `\"sonar-pro\"` ([Perplexity Sonar API: Reliable, Scalable, and Developer-Friendly](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/01/perplexity-sonar-api/#:~:text=client%20%3D%20OpenAI%28api_key%3DYOUR_API_KEY%2C%20base_url%3D)), which shaped the code snippet in `search_web`. The use-case examples (e.g., _financial analysis with real-time insights_) confirmed that Sonar is suitable for our financial domain ([Perplexity Sonar API: Reliable, Scalable, and Developer-Friendly](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/01/perplexity-sonar-api/#:~:text=4,time%20insights%20for%20investors)).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Mistral AI’s Pixtral-12B Announcement:** The E2E Networks blog on Pixtral-12B provided insight into using Mistral’s model for OCR and image understanding ([Guide to Building OCR Systems with Pixtral-12B](https://www.e2enetworks.com/blog/a-guide-to-building-ocr-systems-using-pixtral-12b#:~:text=Pixtral,scale%20OCR)) ([Guide to Building OCR Systems with Pixtral-12B](https://www.e2enetworks.com/blog/a-guide-to-building-ocr-systems-using-pixtral-12b#:~:text=,your%20specific%20OCR%20use%20cases)). This influenced our `analyze_document` design – we described how a multimodal model could handle the task end-to-end, and we mimicked its functionality (extracting text and summarizing it). Also, research like **FinTral (Financial Transdisciplinary AI)** showed the effectiveness of Mistral-7B based models in financial analysis, integrating image (document) data with text ([[2402.10986] FinTral: A Family of GPT-4 Level Multimodal Financial Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10986#:~:text=,Tools%20and%20Retrieval%20methods%2C%20dubbed)), which validated our approach of including document OCR for performance analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash** (Developers Blog and The Keyword): These sources explained what Gemini Flash is – a _“highly efficient workhorse model with low latency”_ meant for tool-using agent tasks ([Gemini 2.0 model updates: 2.0 Flash, Flash-Lite, Pro Experimental](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-updates-february-2025/#:~:text=Experimental%20blog,reason%20through%20more%20complex%20problems)). Reading about how Gemini Flash operates with an agentic system (using web browsing and a huge context window for Deep Research) influenced us to include a “fast agent” component ([Gemini: Try Deep Research and Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental](https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-gemini-deep-research/#:~:text=Earlier%20this%20year%2C%20we%20shared,read%20insights)). We introduced _Gemini-2.0-Flash_ in our pipeline concept to handle quick computations, analogous to how Google’s agent might delegate simpler subtasks to a faster model to save the heavy lifting for the bigger model.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **LangSmith and LangChain Tracing Docs:** The LangSmith documentation guided how we added the `LangChainTracer` for observability. While we kept this section light (since full tracing setup is outside scope), the idea of being able to _log each agent step for debugging_ came from LangSmith’s design philosophy.\n",
